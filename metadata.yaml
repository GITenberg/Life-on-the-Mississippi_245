description: "Life on the Mississippi (1883) is a memoir by Mark Twain of his days\
  \ as a steamboat pilot on the Mississippi River before the American Civil War, and\
  \ also a travel book, recounting his trip along the Mississippi River from St. Louis\
  \ to New Orleans many years after the War.\nThe book begins with a brief history\
  \ of the river as reported by Europeans and Americans, beginning with the Spanish\
  \ explorer Hernando de Soto in 1542. It continues with anecdotes of Twain's training\
  \ as a steamboat pilot, as the 'cub' (apprentice) of an experienced pilot, Horace\
  \ E. Bixby. He describes, with great affection, the science of navigating the ever-changing\
  \ Mississippi River in a section that was first published in 1876, entitled \"Old\
  \ Times on the Mississippi\". Although Twain was actually 21 when he began his training,\
  \ he uses artistic license to make himself seem somewhat younger, referring to himself\
  \ as a \"fledgling\" and a \"boy\" who \"ran away from home\" to seek his fortune\
  \ on the river, and playing up his own callowness and naïveté.\nIn the second half,\
  \ Twain narrates his trip many years later on a steamboat from St. Louis to New\
  \ Orleans. He describes the competition from railroads, and the new, large cities,\
  \ and adds his observations on greed, gullibility, tragedy, and bad architecture.\
  \ He also tells some stories that are most likely tall tales.\nSimultaneously published\
  \ in 1883 in the United States and Great Britain, the book is the first submitted\
  \ to a publisher as a typewritten manuscript.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
